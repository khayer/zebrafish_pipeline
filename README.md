# Zebrafish BWA/PicardTools/GATK pipeline

This pipeline is suppose to automate all the necessary steps between raw sequenced data and called variations.

_Note:_ This gem is under construction!

## The steps

### Aligning the fastq files containing the raw sequenced data with bwa

### Bam-file Conversion/Sort/Index with Picard tools

### Using Picard tools to add read groups

### Marking dublicates in each of the samples (picard tools)

### (Merge all the .bam files)

### Realinging with GATK

### Recalibratiom

### Unified Genotyper

### Evalution of .vcf files
